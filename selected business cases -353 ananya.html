    <h2>Reflections</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</p>
        <p><h3>1. Iteration</h3>
    <p>These activities involve repetitive processes or sequential tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traveling to college every day (repeated routine).</li>
        <li>Playing the game of chess (turn-based sequences).</li>
        <li>Preparing for an assembly (step-by-step organization).</li>
        <li>The process of learning (daily practice and effort).</li>
        <li>Resource management at a wedding (iterative allocation of resources).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Recursion</h3>
    <p>These activities involve self-similar patterns or processes that break down into smaller sub-problems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The tree that has been growing every day (branches resembling the whole tree structure).</li>
        <li>The growth of cauliflower vegetables (fractal patterns).</li>
        <li>Matryoshka dolls (nested structure with self-similarity).</li>
        <li>A calendar (days, weeks, and months recur in predictable patterns).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Backtracking</h3>
    <p>These activities involve exploration, trial and error, or finding solutions by revisiting previous decisions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching for a new friend’s location (exploring different paths or strategies).</li>
        <li>Solving Sudoku (backtracking to correct mistakes).</li>
        <li>The placement of objects (optimizing arrangements by trying alternatives).</li>
    </ul></p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.</p>
        <p><body>
    <h2>Algorithm Efficiency and Complexity</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Time Efficiency:</h3>
        <p>Measures the computational time required to execute an algorithm and represents the number of basic operations performed by an algorithm.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Space Efficiency:</h3>
        <p>Measures the memory (storage) required by an algorithm, tracking how much memory is consumed by the input size and determining how much additional memory is needed to solve a problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <p>A good algorithm executes quickly and saves space in the process. We should find a balance between space and time efficiency (space and time complexity).</p>
        <p>In the world of computer science, to perform better, we need to write algorithms that are time-efficient and use less memory. Algorithms should be resource-optimized, solving larger problems with limited computing power, and improving user experience and system performance.</p>

        <h3>Parental Dominance:</h3>
        <p>Maintain efficiency in heaps by ensuring the root is the largest or smallest element.</p>
    
        <h3>Prefix and Suffix:</h3>
        <p>Key for pattern matching and string operations in tasks like searching and bioinformatics.</p>
    
        <h3>Partitioning:</h3>
        <p>Divide problems into smaller parts for recursion, widely used in sorting and searching.</p>

        <p>5. The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</p>
        <p>Principles of Array Query Algorithms

<LI>Divide and Conquer - Breaking queries into smaller subproblems for efficient computation.</LI><LI> Dynamic Programming - Storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations. Optimization - Balancing preprocessing time with query time to achieve overall efficiency.
</LI>
<LI>Array Query Algorithms: Overview Core Purpose Array query algorithms are designed to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, or analyze information within large datasets, addressing challenges of:

Fast information retrieval Complex data processing Minimizing computational complexity</LI>

<LI>Binary Search(Binary index tree) Principle: Divide and conquer strategy Efficiency: O(log n) Requirements: Sorted array Applications: used in Large sorted databases
</LI>
<LI>Sliding Window Technique

Principle: Maintain a window of elements Efficiency: O(n) Applications: used in Network traffic analysis and Signal processing</LI>

<LI>Segment Tree
Principle: Divide array into segments Efficiency: O(log n) Applications: Range min/max queries</LI></p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p>6. Differentiate between trees and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.</p>
       <p>Tree:

A tree is a simple structure with one main "root" and branches that don’t loop back (no cycles).
It is like a family tree where each person has only one parent (except for the root).
Example: A folder structure on your computer.
Graph:

A graph is more complex. It can have cycles (loops) and no specific structure. Nodes (points) can be connected in many different ways, not necessarily hierarchically.
Example: A map of cities connected by roads, where you can travel in multiple directions.
<LI>Tree Traversals (Ways to visit nodes in a tree):
In-Order: Visit left side, then the node, then right side.
Used for: Sorting data in binary search trees.</LI>
<LI>Pre-Order: Visit the node first, then the left side, and then the right side.
Used for: Making a copy of the tree.</LI>
<LI>Post-Order: Visit the left side first, then the right side, and finally the node.
Used for: Deleting nodes.</LI>
<LI>Level-Order (BFS): Visit nodes level by level from the root.
Used for: Finding the shortest path in simple trees.</LI>
<LI>Graph Traversals (Ways to visit nodes in a graph):
DFS (Depth-First Search): Start at one node, go as deep as possible, and backtrack when needed.

Used for: Solving mazes, finding connected components.</LI>
<LI>BFS (Breadth-First Search): Visit neighbors first, then their neighbors, and so on.

Used for: Finding the shortest path in simple graphs, like finding the shortest route on a map.</LI>
Applications:
<LI>Tree Applications:

File System: Organizing folders and files.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Efficiently finding data in databases.
Decision Trees: Used in making decisions, like in machine learning.</LI>
<LI>Graph Applications:

Social Networks: Connections between people (friends, followers).
Maps/Navigation: Finding the shortest route between cities or locations.
Web Crawlers: Searching the internet by following links between websites.</LI></p>

        <p>7. Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each, and how they connect to the real world.</p>
       <p><section>
        <h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>

        <h3>Bubble Sort:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Compares adjacent items and swaps them if they’re out of order. Repeats until the list is sorted.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Sorting a deck of cards by comparing two cards at a time and swapping them.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> Best for small datasets, inefficient for large ones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Selection Sort:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Finds the smallest item, moves it to the front, and repeats for the rest of the list.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Organizing books by picking the shortest book first.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> Useful when minimizing swaps, but not the fastest for large datasets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Insertion Sort:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Builds a sorted list one item at a time by inserting each item in its correct position.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Sorting a deck of cards by picking and placing cards in the right order.</li>
            <li><strong>Use:</strong> Great for small or nearly sorted datasets.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>9. Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques.</p>
       <p>
           Algorithm Design Techniques:
<LI>Brute Force: Solve problems by trying all possible solutions, guaranteed to find the correct one but inefficient for large inputs.</LI>
<LI>Divide and Conquer: Break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine results (e.g., Merge Sort).</LI>
<LI>Decrease and Conquer: Reduce the problem size by solving a smaller instance of the problem and building up to the solution (e.g., Insertion Sort).</LI>
<LI>Transform and Conquer: Transform the problem into an easier form and solve it more efficiently (e.g., binary search).</LI>
<LI>Greedy Algorithm: Make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping it leads to the global optimum (e.g., Huffman Coding).</LI>

Algorithms:
<LI>Boyer-Moore Algorithm: A string searching algorithm that efficiently finds a substring within a text by skipping sections of the text.
<LI>Rabin-Karp Algorithm: Uses hashing to find a substring in a string, efficient for multiple pattern searches.
<LI>Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph by iteratively selecting the closest node.
<LI>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph, using dynamic programming.
<LI>Kruskal’s Algorithm: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by sorting edges and connecting nodes with the smallest weights without forming cycles.
<LI>Prim’s Algorithm: Finds the MST by growing a tree one edge at a time, always selecting the smallest edge that connects a node to the tree.
<LI>Warshall’s Algorithm: Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph, determining reachability between all pairs of vertices.
       </p>
        <P>There are several key algorithm design techniques, each serving different problem-solving needs. Backtracking explores all possible solutions and discards those that don’t work, useful for problems like N-Queens or Sudoku. Divide and conquer splits a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them individually, and then combines the results, as seen in merge sort and quick sort. Brute force relies on trying every possible solution to find the correct one, used in algorithms like the Rabin-Karp algorithm for string matching. Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Floyd-Warshall help find the shortest path in graphs, while Kruskal’s algorithm is used for finding the minimum spanning tree.</P>
