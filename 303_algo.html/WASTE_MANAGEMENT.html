    <h1>Waste Management and Recycling in City Planning</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>SDG 11.6 - Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
        <p><strong>Target 11.6:</strong> By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.</p>
        <p><strong>Indicator 11.6.1:</strong> Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and well-managed in cities, by sex and income.</p>
        <p><strong>Indicator 11.6.2:</strong> Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in cities (micrograms per cubic meter).</p>
        <p>This case study focuses on waste collection, sorting, and recycling in urban areas. Our goal is to contribute to achieving **Target 11.6** by optimizing waste collection routes and improving recycling rates, directly supporting both indicators.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Case Study: Waste Collection, Sorting, and Recycling</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Optimize waste collection routes, enhance recycling processes, and minimize environmental impact in the city, contributing to SDG Target 11.6 by reducing per capita environmental impacts and improving air quality through better waste management.</p>

        <h3>Challenges and Consequences:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inefficient waste collection routes causing excess fuel consumption and time wastage, contributing to air pollution and PM2.5 levels (Indicator 11.6.2).</li>
            <li>Improper sorting of recyclables leading to contamination and loss of recyclable materials, negatively affecting recycling rates (Indicator 11.6.1).</li>
            <li>Lack of awareness about waste segregation at source leading to mixed waste being collected, complicating recycling efforts (Indicator 11.6.1).</li>
            <li>Limited recycling infrastructure leading to higher amounts of waste going to landfills, contributing to environmental degradation and negative air quality (Indicator 11.6.2).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Solution Approach:</h3>
        <p>We utilize algorithms, data structures, and sorting techniques to solve the waste management and recycling challenges, directly supporting **Target 11.6** by ensuring better waste management practices and helping improve air quality and waste management systems:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Dijkstra's algorithm for optimized waste collection routes, reducing fuel consumption and emissions, thus supporting **Indicator 11.6.2** (reducing PM2.5 levels).</li>
                    <li>Clustering algorithms for grouping collection points based on waste volume and recycling potential, leading to more efficient collection schedules, contributing to **Indicator 11.6.1** by ensuring well-managed waste collection.</li>
                    <li>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for real-time dynamic optimization of collection routes, further reducing emissions from waste collection trucks, which contributes to **Indicator 11.6.2** (PM2.5 reduction).</li>
                    <li>Classification algorithms to identify recyclables and non-recyclables using sensor data, improving sorting practices and helping **Indicator 11.6.1** by improving recycling rates and proper waste management.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Graphs for modeling road networks, collection points, and recycling centers to improve the waste collection efficiency, ensuring better waste management and supporting **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
                    <li>Priority Queues (Heaps) for scheduling collections and prioritizing recycling bins based on fill levels, ensuring timely collection and reducing overflows, which directly supports **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
                    <li>Hash Tables for fast categorization of waste types (recyclable vs. non-recyclable), helping reduce contamination in recycling bins, which supports **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sorting Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quick Sort and Merge Sort for sorting waste collection points based on proximity and waste levels, ensuring efficiency in collection, which supports **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
                    <li>Bucket Sort for organizing waste bins into recyclables (plastic, paper, glass, etc.), ensuring proper sorting and recycling, which supports **Indicator 11.6.1** by improving recycling rates.</li>
                    <li>Radix Sort for sorting waste based on recycling categories and sorting bins by type, reducing contamination and improving recycling quality, supporting **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recycling Practices:</h3>
        <p>Recycling plays a vital role in reducing the environmental impact and conserving resources. Key practices include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Segregation at Source:</strong> Encouraging households and businesses to separate recyclables from general waste. This can be incentivized through educational campaigns and rewards for compliance, improving recycling rates and contributing to **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Sorting:</strong> Using automated sorting facilities with sensors and cameras to identify recyclables such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals. These materials are then separated into specific bins for processing, improving recycling quality and contributing to **Indicator 11.6.1**.</li>
            <li><strong>Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs):</strong> Centralized facilities for sorting, cleaning, and processing recyclables. MRFs can help ensure high-quality recycled materials for reuse in the manufacturing process, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills and supporting both **Indicators 11.6.1** and **11.6.2** (improving waste management and reducing environmental pollution).</li>
        </ul>
