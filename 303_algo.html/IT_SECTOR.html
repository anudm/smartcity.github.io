    <h2>Challenges and Consequences:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Network Congestion: Data traffic between the Data Centers and Software Development Hubs may lead to congestion, causing delays in smart services and inefficiencies in urban management.</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity Risks: Increased interconnectivity within the IT infrastructure makes the city vulnerable to cyber-attacks, compromising both personal and public data.</li>
        <li>Energy Consumption: Energy demands from data centers and smart grid infrastructure could outpace the city's power supply, resulting in high energy costs and potential shortages.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Overload: As the IT sector grows, infrastructure may face overload if scalability is not properly planned, resulting in service degradation and system failures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solutions and Algorithms:</h2>
    <p>The following solutions, algorithms, and data structures are proposed to address the challenges and align with **SDG Goal 11** targets and indicators:</p>

    <h3>1. Network Congestion – Solution:</h3>
    <p>Using Dijkstra's Algorithm for efficient route selection and BFS for monitoring network traffic, we can minimize congestion and improve the performance of the IT infrastructure. The Heap Data Structure is utilized to manage route calculations efficiently. This approach helps ensure optimal traffic distribution between different zones of the IT sector.</p>

    <h3>2. Cybersecurity – Solution:</h3>
    <p>To protect sensitive data, we implement AES Encryption and PKI for secure communication and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for user verification. Additionally, Graph-Based Data Structures and BFS are used to detect vulnerabilities in the network in real-time, allowing for rapid mitigation of security risks.</p>
    <a href="bfs_code.txt" target="_blank" style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 5px; font-size: 16px; transition: background-color 0.3s;" onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='#45a049'" onmouseout="this.style.backgroundColor='#4CAF50'">BFS</a><br>

    <h3>3. Energy Consumption – Solution:</h3>
    <p>To reduce energy consumption, Greedy Algorithms are applied to optimize the energy usage across data centers and technology parks. Furthermore, Smart Sensors and IoT technologies monitor real-time energy use, ensuring adjustments are made as needed to reduce waste and lower costs.</p>

    <h3>4. Infrastructure Scalability – Solution:</h3>
    <p>To ensure scalability, Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are implemented for efficient storage and retrieval of data across different IT zones. This system enables better load distribution and fast response times. Additionally, Quicksort is used for fast data sorting to ensure that the infrastructure can handle large datasets efficiently.</p>

    <h3>5. Disaster Risk Reduction – Solution:</h3>
    <p>Following SDG Goal 11.b, disaster risk reduction strategies will be embedded into the IT sector. This includes the implementation of real-time monitoring systems using IoT devices, integrated with the Smart Grid Infrastructure. Data from various sources will be analyzed using Data Mining techniques to predict and mitigate potential disasters, such as power outages or cyber threats.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Key Focus Areas:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Urban Planning: Integrating IT infrastructure into urban development to optimize land use and manage population growth (Target 11.3).</li>
        <li>Disaster Risk Reduction: Implementing disaster risk reduction strategies in the IT infrastructure as part of the city’s overall resilience (Target 11.b).</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity: Protecting the city’s IT infrastructure through encryption and multi-factor authentication.</li>
