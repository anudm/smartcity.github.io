    <h1>Business Case: IT Industry Case Study</h1>
    <p><strong>Sub-task:</strong> Information Technology</p>
    <p><strong>SDG Goal:</strong> 9</p>
    <p><strong>Target:</strong> 9.4, 9.A</p>
    <p><strong>Indicators:</strong> 9.4.1, 9.A.1</p>

    <p>The IT industry plays a vital role in enhancing industrial innovation and building resilient infrastructures. Below are the specific targets and indicators:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target 9.4:</strong> Upgrade infrastructure and technology to make industries more sustainable.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 9.4.1:</strong> Percentage of industries adopting clean technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Target 9.A:</strong> Increase access to information and communications technology (ICT).</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 9.A.1:</strong> Access to the internet in developing countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The offices and projects related to the IT industry, along with their numbers, are listed below:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Sl. No.</th>
                <th>Office/Project Type</th>
                <th>Number</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Data Centers</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Software Development Firms</td>
                <td>8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Tech Startups</td>
                <td>12</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>Cloud Service Providers</td>
                <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>Cybersecurity Agencies</td>

    <p>The above data is based on the industry design, and the cost of communication between these locations is estimated. Below is a representation of the network routes:</p>

        <p><strong>Fig 1:</strong> IT Industry Network Map</p>
    </div>

    <p>An optimal route is prepared for IT professionals using Dijkstra's algorithm. The code can be viewed 
        <a href="djcode.txt" target="_blank">HERE</a>. The algorithm is implemented using a Heap data structure, and the efficiency is 
        <em>|E|log|V|</em>, utilizing a greedy technique. This case study demonstrates the use of Dijkstra's algorithm in optimizing IT industry logistics.
    </p>

    <p>Another approach is to use the BFS algorithm for searching through IT offices and projects. In the worst case, the algorithm would make all the m comparisons before shifting the pattern, with a worst-case efficiency of O(nm). The code for this approach can be viewed 
        <a href="bfsscode.txt" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Additionally, we can utilize the KMP and Boyer-Moore algorithms for pattern matching.
