    <h1>City Plan - Industrial Sector</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Case Study: Industrial Sector Infrastructure Optimization</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve the efficiency and sustainability of industrial zones, focusing on waste management, resource utilization, and infrastructure optimization.</p>

        <h3>Challenges and Consequences:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inefficient waste disposal systems:</strong> Industrial zones generate large amounts of waste, including hazardous materials, with improper disposal leading to environmental pollution and health hazards.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic congestion:</strong> Heavy trucks and industrial vehicles cause traffic jams in industrial zones, leading to delays and increased fuel consumption.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource wastage:</strong> Excessive energy and water usage in industrial activities, contributing to resource depletion and increased operational costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of real-time monitoring:</strong> Insufficient data collection and real-time monitoring of industrial processes lead to inefficiencies and higher operational costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Solution Approach:</h3>
        <p>The following methods are applied to address the industrial sector challenges:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP):</strong> Using Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize truck routes within the industrial zones, reducing traffic congestion and fuel consumption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cluster Analysis:</strong> Using K-Means clustering to group industries based on resource consumption and waste output, optimizing resource allocation and waste management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Linear Programming:</strong> To minimize resource wastage (water, energy) by optimizing production schedules and resource distribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> For mapping transportation networks and modeling the interconnection between industries and waste disposal facilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority Queues (Heaps):</strong> Used for scheduling maintenance activities and waste pickups based on urgency and capacity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hash Tables:</strong> To track real-time data for waste types, recycling rates, and energy consumption at different industrial sites.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sorting Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quick Sort:</strong> Used to sort transportation routes or industries by their waste output or energy consumption for prioritization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merge Sort:</strong> Helps in sorting waste items into categories like recyclable and non-recyclable based on predefined criteria.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SDG 11 Targets in the Context of Industrial Sector:</h3>
        <p>The following SDG targets are crucial for developing a sustainable industrial sector in city planning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="sdg">11.1:</span> Ensure access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services, and upgrade slums. <strong>Relevance:</strong> Providing industrial workers with safe and affordable housing near work areas to reduce congestion and improve quality of life.</li>
            <li><span class="sdg">11.3:</span> Enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. <strong>Relevance:</strong> Implementing data-driven solutions to optimize land use and minimize the environmental impact of industrial zones.</li>
            <li><span class="sdg">11.c:</span> Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials. <strong>Relevance:</strong> Supporting industrial zones in developing countries with sustainable technologies, waste management practices, and energy-efficient systems to promote resilience.</li>
        </ul>
