    <h1>City Plan - Industrial Sector with Greedy Algorithms</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Case Study: Industrial Sector Optimization</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Optimize industrial infrastructure using greedy algorithms for transportation, resource management, and network connectivity.</p>

        <h3>Challenges and Consequences:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inefficient industrial zone connectivity:</strong> The cost and time to connect various industrial zones (e.g., roads, electricity, water pipelines) are not optimized.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource wastage:</strong> Resources like energy and water are consumed inefficiently in industrial zones due to poor allocation and scheduling.</li>
            <li><strong>Suboptimal routing:</strong> Industrial vehicles are not taking the most efficient routes, leading to increased fuel consumption and delays.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Solution Approach Using Greedy Algorithms:</h3>
        <p>Greedy algorithms are ideal for optimizing various industrial tasks:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prim's Algorithm:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used for minimum spanning tree (MST) to connect various industrial zones with the least cost or distance. By adding the nearest neighboring zone to the network, Prim's ensures minimum cost for infrastructure such as roads, pipelines, and electricity lines.</li>
                    <a href="Prims_algorithm.txt" target="_blank">Prim's Code</a>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Kruskal's Algorithm:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Also used for minimum spanning tree (MST). Kruskal's algorithm works by sorting all the edges in increasing order of weight (cost), and adding edges that don’t form a cycle. This can be used to optimize the construction of roads, water pipes, and electrical grid networks.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Boyer-Moore Algorithm:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This string-matching algorithm is useful for analyzing logs or finding patterns in industrial data, such as detecting anomalies or specific conditions in production lines or monitoring systems.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>SDG 11 Targets in the Context of Industrial Sector:</h3>
        <p>The following SDG targets are applied to the industrial sector in this city plan:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="sdg">11.1:</span> Ensure access for all to adequate, safe, and affordable housing and basic services, and upgrade slums. <strong>Relevance:</strong> Optimized infrastructure ensures safe and accessible housing near industrial zones, reducing commuting times and increasing productivity.</li>
            <li><span class="sdg">11.3:</span> Enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated, and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries. <strong>Relevance:</strong> Using Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for efficient infrastructure development supports sustainable growth and optimized urbanization.</li>
            <li><span class="sdg">11.c:</span> Support least developed countries, including through financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings utilizing local materials. <strong>Relevance:</strong> Greedy algorithms help prioritize resource distribution to areas that need them most, ensuring efficiency and sustainability in urban development.</li>
        </ul>
