    <h1>Course Project Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Problem Space:</h2>
    <p>Cities are growing fast. This causes problems like crowded roads, more pollution, and not enough resources like water and power. We need better ways to handle these issues to make cities better for people.</p>
    
    <h2>White Paper Findings:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Tech Ideas:</strong> Street lights that save energy, apps to guide traffic, and sensors to track water use.</li>
        <li><strong>Successful Cities:</strong> Cities like Copenhagen use bikes and solar panels to save energy and reduce pollution.</li>
        <li><strong>Problems:</strong> It costs a lot to add new systems, and some people don’t trust or know how to use the technology.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>City Design:</h2>
    <p>To make smart cities, we can follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fix old roads, water pipes, and buildings.</li>
        <li>Add simple tools like traffic cameras and air quality sensors.</li>
        <li>Test ideas in small neighborhoods first.</li>
        <li>Make sure everyone can use the technology easily.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Business Cases:</h2>
    <p>Businesses can share costs by paying for services like parking apps or using solar power. This way, cities save money and grow smarter together.</p>
    
    <h2>Problem Definition:</h2>
    <p>
        Cities are facing problems like traffic jams, bad air, and old systems that don’t work well anymore. 
        Our project focuses on using simple technologies, like apps and sensors, to solve these problems. 
        The goal is to help cities save energy, reduce pollution, and make life easier and safer for everyone.
