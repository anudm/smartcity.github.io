    <h1>Course Project Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Problem Space:</h2>
    <p>Cities are growing fast, leading to issues like traffic, pollution, and resource shortages. Experts identified these by talking to people, analyzing data, and focusing on areas like transport, energy, and waste.</p>
    
    <h2>White Paper Findings:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tech Solutions:</strong> Smart sensors, AI, and secure systems like blockchain can tackle urban problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Success Stories:</strong> Cities like Singapore show how smart tech improves traffic, energy, and quality of life.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> High costs, privacy concerns, and tech resistance are big hurdles.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>City Design:</h2>
    <p>Smart cities are built in steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Upgrade old infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Add tech like sensors and AI.</li>
        <li>Test ideas with virtual models.</li>
        <li>Ensure systems are user-friendly.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Business Cases:</h2>
    <p>Costs are shared with businesses, and money is earned through services, energy savings, and licensing tech. We have identified many business cases.</p>
    
    <h2>Problem Definition:</h2>
    <p>
        Cities are growing fast, causing problems like traffic jams, poor resource management, pollution, and outdated infrastructure. 
        These issues lower the quality of life and make cities less sustainable. 
        Our project focuses on using smart technologies, like sensors and automated systems, to solve these problems. 
        By improving transportation, waste management, energy use, and public safety, the goal is to make cities more efficient, eco-friendly, and livable for everyone.
