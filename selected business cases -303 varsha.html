    <div class="question">
        <p>4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, BST, AVL, 2-3, Red-Black, Heap, Trie).</p>
        <p><strong>Ans:</strong><br><strong>Hierarchical Data & Tree Data Structures</strong><br>Hierarchical data shows parent-child relationships and can be effectively represented using tree data structures. These trees have special properties that make operations faster, depending on their type and purpose.<br><strong>General Tree:</strong> A binary search tree (BST) is a special kind of binary tree where the left child is smaller, and the right child is greater than the parent. It allows efficient searching and inserting with an average time of O(log n). But if it gets unbalanced, performance can drop to O(n).<br><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> An AVL Tree is a balanced version of a binary search tree. It keeps itself balanced by ensuring a strict condition at every node. Because of this, operations like searching, inserting, and deleting have a guaranteed time of O(log n), even in the worst case. It's ideal for real-time systems.<br><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A Red-Black Tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree. It uses a color system (red or black) to quickly balance itself, requiring fewer adjustments than AVL trees. It works efficiently for tasks like database indexing and managing ordered data.<br><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> A 2-3 tree is a balanced tree where each node can have two or three children. It is great for database indexing and supports efficient searching and inserting with a time complexity of O(log n). It's an alternative to B-Trees for managing ordered datasets.<br><strong>Heap:</strong> A heap is a type of tree that maintains a property where the largest or smallest value is always at the root. Heaps are used in priority queues, scheduling tasks, and sorting. They allow fast access to the maximum or minimum value in O(1) time and insertion or deletion in O(log n).<br><strong>Trie:</strong> A Trie, or prefix tree, is a tree optimized for storing and searching strings. Each branch represents a single character, which makes prefix-based lookups very fast. They're commonly used in features like autocomplete, dictionary lookups, or routing. However, they use a lot of memory for very large datasets.</p>
