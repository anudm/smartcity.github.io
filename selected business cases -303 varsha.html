        <p><strong>4. The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, BST, AVL, 2-3, Red-Black, Heap, Trie).</strong></p>
        <div class="answer">
            <strong>Hierarchical Data & Tree Data Structures:</strong><br>
            Hierarchical data shows parent-child relationships and can be effectively represented using tree data structures.<br><br>
            <strong>General Tree:</strong><br>
            A binary search tree (BST) is a special kind of binary tree where the left child is smaller, and the right child is greater than the parent.<br>
            <strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST that ensures O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.<br>
            <strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST using color-coding to ensure efficient performance.<br>
            <strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> A balanced tree with nodes that can have two or three children, often used for indexing in databases.<br>
            <strong>Heap:</strong> A binary tree used for priority queues where the maximum (or minimum) value is always at the root.<br>
            <strong>Trie:</strong> A tree used for string searching and prefix-based queries like autocomplete.<br><br>
            <strong>Choosing the Right Tree:</strong><br>
            - Trie: Best for autocomplete or prefix-based searches.<br>
            - Heap: Great for priority queues or task scheduling.<br>
            - AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree: Best for frequent searching and inserting in ordered data.<br>

        <p><strong>5. The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.</strong></p>
        <div class="answer">
            <strong>The Need for Array Query Algorithms:</strong><br>
            Array query algorithms help us quickly search, retrieve, and update data in arrays. Arrays store data in consecutive memory spaces, but without efficient algorithms, operations on large arrays can become very slow. These algorithms save time and make data processing faster, especially when dealing with big datasets.<br><br>
            <strong>Why We Need Them:</strong><br>
            These algorithms make data operations faster, especially in real-time systems, big data, and database searches.<br><br>
            <strong>Principles of Array Query Algorithms:</strong><br>
            - Efficient Searching: Methods like binary search speed up the process.<br>
            - Preprocessing Data: Preparing data for faster searches.<br>
            - Divide and Conquer: Breaking problems into smaller parts.<br>
            - Efficient Memory Use: Ensuring minimal memory use while working quickly.<br><br>
            <strong>Applications:</strong><br>
            These algorithms are used in databases, real-time systems like traffic and stock trading, search engines, and big data analysis.<br><br>
            <strong>Implications:</strong><br>
            Using the right algorithms speeds up data operations and ensures systems work efficiently, especially for large datasets.

        <p><strong>6. Differentiate between trees and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.</strong></p>
        <div class="answer">
            <strong>Difference Between Trees and Graphs:</strong><br>
            A tree is a special type of graph with a hierarchical structure, while a graph can have multiple paths, loops, and no clear hierarchy.<br><br>
            <strong>Traversals:</strong><br>
            In trees: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order.<br>
            In graphs: BFS and DFS.<br><br>
            <strong>Applications:</strong><br>
            - Trees: Binary search trees (for efficient data storage), Heaps (for priority queues), Tries (for string searches).<br>
            - Graphs: Social networks, maps, web crawling, and circuit analysis.

            Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order, making it easier to search and analyze.<br><br>
            <strong>Techniques Behind Sorting:</strong><br>
            - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.<br><br>
            <strong>Real-World Use of Sorting:</strong><br>
