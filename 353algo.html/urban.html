    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To enhance accessibility, reduce travel costs, and prioritize green space projects for sustainable development.</p>

    <h2>Steps and Applications</h2>

    <h3>1. Optimizing Green Space Connectivity</h3>
    <p class="highlight">Using <strong>Kruskal’s Algorithm</strong>, planners developed a Minimum Spanning Tree that connects 10 green spaces with minimal road construction costs.</p>
    <h2>Kruskal’s Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Kruskal’s algorithm is a Greedy algorithm used for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. It sorts all the edges in increasing order of their weights and adds them one by one to the spanning tree, provided they do not form a cycle. To view the code of kruskal's <a href="kruskal.txt">click here</a>
</p>
        <p>Key points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorts the edges and adds them in sequence if no cycles are formed.</li>
            <li>It is used for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.</li>
            <li>Falls under the Greedy technique.</li>
            <li>With an efficient union-find algorithm, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(|E| log |E|), where E is the number of edges.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>2. Analyzing Accessibility</h3>
    <p class="highlight">The <strong>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</strong> identified the shortest paths between key locations, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Parks</li>
        <li>Recycling centers</li>
        <li>Public transport hubs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interventions were proposed for areas with high travel times.</p>
   <ul>
            <li>Based on the principle of Kleene’s Theorem.</li>
            <li>Used for All-Pairs Shortest Path problems.</li>
            <li>Falls under the dynamic programming technique (principle of optimality).</li>
            <li>The algorithm has cubic time complexity, i.e., O(|V|^3), where V is the number of vertices in the graph.To view code  <a href="floyds.txt">click here</a></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>3. Prioritizing Development Projects</h3>
    <p class="highlight">Projects were ranked based on urgency and impact using <strong>Merge Sort</strong>. Top projects include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Converting unused land into parks</li>
        <li>Upgrading roads to reduce travel times</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
        <p>Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm for sorting an array. It divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.</p>
        <p>Merge Sort has an efficiency of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array being sorted. To view code  <a href="merge.txt">click here</a></p>
   
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced costs of developing green spaces by 20% using the MST approach.</li>
        <li>Improved accessibility to public facilities, reducing average travel times by 15%.</li>
        <li>Timely execution of high-impact projects through data-driven prioritization.</li>
    </ul>
