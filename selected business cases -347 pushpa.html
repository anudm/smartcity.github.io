    <h1>COURSE REFLECTIONS</h1>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>1) What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</h2>
      <p>In daily life, iteration can be seen in repeating tasks like brushing your teeth every morning or counting steps while walking. Recursion is like looking into two facing mirrors that reflect infinitely or peeling layers of an onion repeatedly. Backtracking is what you do when retracing your steps to find lost keys or deciding the best route to avoid traffic after taking a wrong turn. These problem-solving methods mirror natural processes in our everyday routines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2) What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth</h2>
      <p>Space and time efficiency help us solve problems in a way that saves resources and reduces delays. For example, space efficiency ensures we use minimal memory, like packing a suitcase smartly to fit everything. Time efficiency is about completing tasks quickly, such as using a faster route to reach work instead of wasting time in traffic. These are important for handling large-scale problems, like using less storage in your phone for apps or speeding up searches on your computer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3) Take away from different design principles from chapter 2 (can use the notes provided)</h2>
      <p>Studying different trees helped clarify how structures optimize efficiency. Binary trees are simple but can become unbalanced, making operations slower. AVL trees address this by maintaining balance through rotations, ensuring operations stay efficient. Red-Black trees offer a similar benefit with a more flexible balancing approach. 2-3 trees group nodes to stay balanced, simplifying splits and merges. These trees highlight how balance and structure are crucial in algorithm design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4) The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios</h2>
      <p>Trees help organize data in a hierarchy for efficient use. Binary Search Trees allow fast searches but can get unbalanced. AVL trees fix this by staying balanced with rotations. Red-Black trees also balance but are a bit more flexible. Heaps are great for priority tasks, like finding the largest or smallest. Tries work well for prefix searches, like words in a dictionary, and 2-3 trees ensure balance by grouping nodes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5) The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed</h2>
      <p>Array query algorithms help to quickly find sums or minimums in arrays. They are used in databases, search engines, games, and data analysis. They work by organizing data to make searches faster. Their principle is to split data into parts and store useful results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6) Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each</h2>
      <p>Trees are hierarchical structures with one root and no cycles while graphs can have multiple connections and cycles. Tree traversals like in-order and pre-order visit nodes in a specific order, while graph traversals like BFS and DFS explore all nodes. Trees are used in filesystems and databases while graphs are used in social networks and maps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7) Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and they connect to real world</h2>
      <p>Sorting and searching algorithms are essential for organizing and finding data. Each algorithm has specific advantages for different types of problems. For example, bubble sort is simple but inefficient, while merge sort is faster for large datasets. Quick sort is highly efficient and widely used, while heap sort is useful in priority queues. Searching algorithms, like binary search, allow for fast lookups, which is crucial in applications like databases and search engines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8) Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths</h2>
      <p>Graph algorithms are crucial for finding optimal solutions in network-related problems. Spanning tree algorithms like Kruskal’s and Prim’s help connect all nodes with the fewest edges, minimizing cost and improving efficiency in scenarios like network design and wiring systems. Shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Floyd’s find the quickest route between two points, making them valuable for applications like navigation systems or optimizing transportation routes. These algorithms help ensure resources are used efficiently and costs are reduced in many real-world systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>9) Discuss about the different studied algorithm design techniques</h2>
      <p>There are several key algorithm design techniques, each serving different problem-solving needs. Backtracking explores all possible solutions and discards those that don’t work, useful for problems like N-Queens or Sudoku. Divide and conquer splits a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them individually, and then combines the results, as seen in merge sort and quick sort. Brute force relies on trying every possible solution to find the correct one, used in algorithms like the Rabin-Karp algorithm for string matching. Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Floyd-Warshall help find the shortest path in graphs, while Kruskal’s algorithm is used for finding the minimum spanning tree.</p>
